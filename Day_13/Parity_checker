Topic       : Parity Checker

Functiona   :

* This code implements a parity checker for 8-bit data.

* It calculates the number of 1's in the data and checks if it's even or odd.

* Based on the parity type (even or odd, configured by the user), the output parity indicates if there's a mismatch in the number of 1's compared to the expected parity.
